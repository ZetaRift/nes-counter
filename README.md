# nes-counter

A simple NES program that acts as a counter timed by the PPU

It was previously written without the use of sprites to show the counter on the screen [here](https://gist.github.com/ZetaRift/b502e803ee645489be6a2a855fb46fbb)

Pressing any D-pad buttons will move the sprites on the screen, and pressing A resets the counter (including the frame counter)
